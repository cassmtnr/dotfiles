## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-22

### 🚀 Performance Improvements
- **Shell Startup Speed**: Optimized from 3.78s to 0.184s (95% improvement)
  - Added completion caching with daily refresh
  - Implemented lazy loading for NVM/Node.js tools
  - Optimized compinit execution with `-C` flag
- **Memory Usage Analysis**: Identified and documented memory consumers
  - Microsoft Teams: 1.5GB (primary consumer)
  - VS Code TypeScript servers: ~900MB each
  - Total system memory: 35GB/38GB (normal for development workload)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- **Node.js Package Managers**: Fixed "env: node: No such file or directory" error
  - Added lazy loading for `yarn` and `pnpm` commands
  - Ensures NVM loads before any Node.js package manager execution
- **Starship Prompt Timeouts**: Fixed Node.js command timeouts
  - Increased `command_timeout` from 500ms to 3000ms
  - Prevents timeout errors when using Node.js tools with lazy loading

### 🏗️ Architecture Changes
- **Modular Configuration**: Moved personal/work settings to `~/.zshrc.local`
  - Removed `flow()` function from shared dotfiles for privacy
  - Work-specific aliases and environment variables externalized
- **SSH Configuration**: Validated and organized key management
  - Personal GitHub key: `~/.ssh/personal/github`
  - Work GitLab key: `~/.ssh/work/gitlab`
  - SSH agent properly loads both keys on startup

### 🛡️ Security
- **SSH Key Organization**: Structured directory layout maintained
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data in gitignored files
- **Permission Validation**: SSH keys have correct 600/644 permissions

### 📊 Metrics
- **Shell Startup Time**: 0.184s (target: <1s) ✅
- **Memory Usage**: 35GB/38GB (92% - normal for development) ✅
- **SSH Keys Loaded**: 2 keys (personal + work) ✅
- **Git Configuration**: Properly configured with user settings ✅

### 🧪 Testing
- **Syntax Validation**: All shell files pass `zsh -n` checks
- **Installation Test**: `./install.sh --dry-run` validates successfully
- **SSH Connectivity**: Keys loaded, though network connectivity varies by environment

### 📝 Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with current system state and metrics
- **Performance Profiling**: Added zprof integration for debugging
- **Todo List**: Completed all optimization tasks

### 🔄 Maintenance
- **Automated Monitoring**: Claude Flow metrics tracking active
- **Real-time Performance**: System metrics in `.claude-flow/metrics/`
